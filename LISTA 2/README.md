## LISTA 2 - APENAS IMPLEMENTAÇÃO DA QUESTÃO 11

11. Implement a performance-measuring environment simulator for the vacuum-cleaner world depicted in Figure 2.8 and specified on page . Your implementation should be modular so that the sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics (size, shape, dirt placement, etc.) can be changed easily. (Note: for some choices of programming language and operating system there are already implementations in the online code repository.)

## solution !
I've used a vector which position 0 indicates where is the vacuum and position 1 indicates if it is dirty or not. 
I used used the random function so it could randomly saying if it is dirty or not and >0.5 as the verification to being clean or not as a 50/50 chance
